Reddit bot that will give you your top ten most used comments, along with other information such as unique words and total word count.

Python Implementation: 

     - Use PRAW: a wrapper for reddit API: https://praw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
     - Collects used comments of user -> graphs top ten used words using matplotlib. 

Java Implementation: 

     - Kind of works (my first Java project). 
     - Uses karan's jReddit API wrapper to manipulate reddit data: https://github.com/karan/jReddit. 
     - The wrapper isn't complete so this implementation is very limited.
     - It is mostly just an exercise for myself.
